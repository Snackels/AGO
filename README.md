# **Part 1: About our team.**
*YBR-AGO* comprises three students from Yothinburana School. Our team consists of two members from year 11 and one from year 10. Last year, we achieved 7th place on the international stage, and we used that experience to enhance our robot’s design and teamwork.
Here are the team members.
1. Vorawet Narkglom, 16 years old.

2. Chaiwat Chinsupawat, 15 years old.

3. Vichaiwat Koonsap, 16 years old.


# **Part 2: Robot Design.**
### The Robot

Designing a good robot is indeed a challenging task as it requires a lot of consideration and planning to ensure it can move swiftly and follow specific rules. One of the primary requirements is that the robot must be a four-wheeled vehicle with one driving axle and one steering actuator, which is why we carefully chose these components. After selecting all the necessary components, we had to figure out how to make them all fit together. For instance, we placed the gyro around the middle-top of the robot to get the most accurate output, while the camera was positioned at the back-top to detect objects quickly.

We also included a separate button to start the program quickly and avoid accidentally moving the robot while trying to push the start button. Our robot has two servos, one on the bottom front and one on the top front. The bottom front servo is used to steer the wheel, and we had to remake the front part of the robot because we faced a problem during the national round. The robot was too slim, and when we steered too much, it acted like a brake, making it difficult to maneuver. So, we made the robot slightly larger to prevent this issue.

Finally, we added a top servo that rotates our ultrasonic. Initially, we thought of using two ultrasonics, but we realized that the waves could hit each other, making the received data inaccurate. Therefore, we designed our robot to have a single ultrasonic, which ensured that the data we received was precise. 

Additionally, the rules also said that:

The vehicle's dimensions must not exceed 300x200 mm, with a height limit of 300 mm.
The weight of the vehicle must not exceed 1.5 kilograms.
