# **Part 1: About our team.**
*YBR-AGO* comprises three students from Yothinburana School. Our team consists of two members from year 11 and one from year 10. Last year, we achieved 7th place on the international stage, and we used that experience to enhance our robot’s design and teamwork.
Here are the team members.
1. Vorawet Narkglom, 16 years old.

2. Chaiwat Chinsupawat, 15 years old.

3. Vichaiwat Koonsap, 16 years old.


# **Part 2: Robot Design.**
### The Robot

Designing a robot for this competition is sometime hard. We need to design it to be compact, lightweight, durable, and have all the functions we need. The robot must be four-wheeled with a steering function on either front or back wheel, which is why we need to be careful to pick the components. After we select all the components we need, then we think about how to put them all together. We came up with two choices. The first is with Lego Technic parts, but due to its size and weigh,which must be 300x200mm and 300mm in height, that makes it hard to design a compact robot. So we decided to use a 3D-printed robot for more lightweight, and we can also put the component anywhere we want with just designing. 

3D printing is also not easy since we need to be precise; every hole and component size must fit into places we want. We failed a few times before coming up with the design we use now. After finishing designing, we printed it out to see the result with our own 3D printer and using ABS filaments. The robot color also shouldn't be green and red since the camera can be confused with the obstracle.

For the design, we placed the gyro around the middle-top of the robot to get the most accurate output, while the camera was positioned at the front of the gyro to detect objects quickly.

 Our robot has two servos, one on the bottom front and one on the top front. The bottom front servo is used to steer the wheel. Then, we added a top servo that rotates our ultrasonic. We use an ultrasonic to keep our robot out of the wall. Finally, we place our motor at the bottom back of the robot, and to ensure that it drives both wheels at the back, we use a gear differential from Lego.
